If the player wanted to become viable at the game, it was understood that a certain level of raw mechanical skill with the mouse and keyboard as well as an understanding of when to use weapons, would suffice.</p> <p>Now that the duel gamemode has evolved through the decades, the skill &quot;celiing&quot; has risen, and even the average player has to understand more than just aiming well, to even understand the competitive aspect of the gamemode.</p> <p>A player would have to know how to utilize advanced movement mechanics and how to control the map, on top of how to increase weapon proficiency.</p> <h2 id="movement"><a href="#movement" class="header-anchor">#</a> Movement</h2> <p>One of the major techniques that a player must utilize and master, is movement. Regular movement, that is holding any one of the WASD keys, would move a player with 320 units per second of speed. A player can jump with the spacebar, about 45 units high. In the installment of <em>Diabotical</em>, the player also has the ability to use <strong>boosts</strong>, which allows the player to obtain an instant burst of speed (445 units per second) with the shift key. With just these mechanics, a player has all that they need to dodge rockets, to aim while strafing (tracking an opponent with minor mousemovement, only utilizing the A and D keys), and to get around the map.</p> <p>Advanced movements, although difficult to master, are important to at least understand. In duel, the two main techniques are strafe-jumping and rocket-jumping.</p> <p>Strafe-jumping is considered an accidental glitch in the <em>Quake 3 Arena</em> game, where the player combines continuous jumping, the forward key and either strafe key, while moving the mouse in a constant speed in the strafing direction, to gain acceleration while. This performance is usually done in beats, where the player would alternate the strafe keys and the mouse position after every two jumps. In <em>Diabotical</em>, holding down the jump button will automatically make the player jump if they hit the ground.</p> <p>For example, a strafe-jumping cycle could be:</p> <p>Holding forward and jump, looking about 15 degrees left of the intended direction, and holding the A key to strafe left. The player would have to look &quot;outwards&quot; at a constant speed from the intended direction of movement to accelerate.</p> <p>After two jumps, the player would change from pressing A to pressing D to strafe right, and the player would have to &quot;jump&quot; the mouse to the mirrored angle about the intended axis (if the player's aim is about 45 degrees to the left of the intended direction, the aim should now be about 45 degrees to the right of the intended direction).</p> <p>At the end of this cycle, the player would now reach upwards to about 750 units per second.</p> <p>This diagram made by <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rTsXO6Zicls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matt's Ramblings<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> shows the physics behind strafe-jumping.</p> <p><img src="/dbtguide/assets/img/strafe-jumping.ba119d94.gif" alt="Strafe-jumping"></p> <p>Rocket-jumping is an easier mechanic to utilize. With the rocket launcher in hand, the player can perform a rocket-jump by shooting a rocket at the players feet (by pressing Left Click with the rocket launcher in hand), and jumping.  This can enable to achieve a vertical jump of about 280 units in the air, at the cost of about 50 damage. This is a mechanic that should be used with caution even at high stacks.</p> <p>These advanced mechanics can surprise the opponent, and can help with getting out of situations that are unfavorable.</p> <h2 id="strategic-timings"><a href="#strategic-timings" class="header-anchor">#</a> Strategic Timings</h2> <p>Knowing when to attack or defend a position, is what is referred to as map control. Map control persists of laying traps while controlling a part of the map, surprising an opponent at a position away from the key items, or attacking the opponent to obtain a key item.</p> <p>In the beginning of a map, the player is guaranteed to have control of a key item of the map. The starting position of a player can be either next to Red, or next to Mega. As the player needs to gather weapons as well, it is key that the major item that is obtained as fast as possible, so that the opponent cannot obtain both key items in the first 40 seconds of the game. While obtaining weapons, there is a very high chance that the player will make first contact with the opponent, as the opponent will be obtaining weapons as well. The motive at this stage is to deal as much damage as possible, to achieve a net positive over the opponent, even if the player ends up getting defeated at this battle. After the exchange, the game dynamic changes, as now there will be a player &quot;in-control&quot; and a player&quot;out-of-control&quot;.</p> <h3 id="staying-in-control"><a href="#staying-in-control" class="header-anchor">#</a> Staying In-Control</h3> <p>If the player has defeated the opponent during this first exchange, he is in-control of the map. While the opponent is waiting to spawn, the player can gather health and armor so that the player will have a guaranteed advantage , also called being &quot;stacked&quot;. As the key items would have respawned by now, the next course-of-action for the player would be to obtain one of those key items. The choice of what to choose between the two key items, Red and Mega, depends on the map.</p> <p>For example, on Bioplant:</p> <p><img src="/dbtguide/assets/img/bioplant.86ac5591.png" alt="Bioplant"></p> <p>Mega is easy to get to from the Blue armor north of it, so the player can acquire both swiftly, coming out with a stack of more than 200 health and 50 armor.</p> <p>After acquring Mega, the player has a choice to defend Mega, or to hunt the opponent from acquiring weapons. This choice relies on information, which requires the player to be intuitive. In Diabotical, a player can spawn on any spawnpoint a certain radius away from the opponent. In Bioplant, for instance, if the player is in the middle of the map, the opponent has an equal chance to spawn by the Blue armor on the left, in the hallway by Red armor and health bubbles, or south of the map which is by shaft and Red armor. Hearing helps aid the choice to be made, and can lead to traps being laid. While holding a key area of the map, a player can predict where the opponent can be by hearing for footsteps, and shooting rockets at doorways and other openings can deny areas. This generally will not frag the opponent as the opponent will be hesitant to push traps, and is utilized more to obtain information. A more certain outcome would be to attack the opponent by surprise, but at the risk of losing a life and losing the possessed key area.</p> <p>Staying in-control means to lose as little health and armor as possible, while controlling a key area of a map.</p> <h3 id="establishing-control-when-out-of-control"><a href="#establishing-control-when-out-of-control" class="header-anchor">#</a> Establishing Control when Out-Of-Control</h3> <p>If the player loses the first exchange, then the player is &quot;out-of-control&quot;. The player has to wait to spawn, and hopefully gather weapons, health and armor. As the opponent is likely around a certain key item, it is best for the player to not be anywhere near that key area at all. The player should focus on gathering weapons, and acquiring a light stack of health and armor (100 health and 75 armor is a good stack to have out-of-control). To come out with an advantage, it is up to the player to obtain a plan to create opportunities.</p> <p>For example, if the opponent is holding Mega on Bioplant, the player can get a PNCR shot off through any of the openings, which should be enough to initiate a push by a player, with the rocket launcher or shaft to obtain control by fragging the opponent, or by forcing the opponent to leave.</p> <p>Of course, there is no set flow of a game, there are many outcomes to all the situations that can be presented during a match. Intuition is key.</p> <h2 id="weapon-usage-accuracy"><a href="#weapon-usage-accuracy" class="header-anchor">#</a> Weapon Usage Accuracy</h2> <p>As Arena First-person Shooter games, such as <em>Diabotical</em>, take place on the Personal Computer, the player must be proficient and comfortable with using the mouse and keyboard to play these types of games. As there are other FPS games on the PC that are quite popular, even if the player has never touched an Arena type game, translation between the other games and <em>Diabotical</em>, is not quite different. However, as the weapons in <em>Diabotical</em> are substantally vast, it is key to understand the different kinds of aiming and how those apply to <em>Diabotical</em>.</p> <p>In the area of First-person shooters, there is a consensus that there are two different types of aiming: click aiming and tracking.</p> <p>Click aiming, or click timing, is the act of clicking at the right time when passing the crosshair (the middle of the screen) through an opponent for instantaneous feedback or hit. This type of aiming is left to high damage/low fire rate weapons, such as the PNCR in <em>Diabotical</em>. This type of aiming is more dependent on reactivity than tracking.</p> <p>Tracking is the act of making the crosshair be always on a moving opponent, and is done with high fire rate weapons, such as the shaft in <em>Diabotical</em>. This type of aiming is dependent on movement prediction and correction.</p> <p>As these two mechanics are simple at its core, improving aim is through correct and helpful repetition.</p> <h3 id="routines-for-increasing-weapon-accuracy"><a href="#routines-for-increasing-weapon-accuracy" class="header-anchor">#</a> Routines for Increasing Weapon Accuracy</h3> <p>Correct repetition can be done through aim trainers, or just by playing the game. <em>Diabotical</em> itself has an aim trainer that has different scenarios for click aiming and tracking, although other third-party aim trainers such as <em>Kovaak 2.0</em> or <em>Aim Lab</em> have more scenarios. As the player gets more and more situated with aiming, spending time with these third-party aim trainers can elevate a player's aim even more. As aim can be lost quite significantly over times of non-training, many professional players like to use aim trainers to warm up for their respective games. Here is an example of someone playing the Ascended Tracking v2.0 scenario in <em>Kovaak 2.0</em> for tracking:</p> <p><img src="/dbtguide/assets/img/download.e0f39570.gif" alt="Kovaak"></p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
